## CloudNative Microservices, Container, Orchestators, Service Mesh, CI/CD, IaC, GitOps, Monitoring
Learn how to Design and Build Cloud-Native Apps with Microservices Architecture, Kubernetes Deployments, Communications, Backing Services, CI/CD pipelines and Monitoring Patterns and Best Practices.

Cloud-native is a huge topic that need to organize how to digest all topics well. In every step, we will follow Cloud-native Pillars, with learning Cloud-Native architecture and visit Cloud-Native tools, explore and understand these tools, design architecture with these tools and finally develop +20 Hands-on real-world project on Kubernetes clusters.
